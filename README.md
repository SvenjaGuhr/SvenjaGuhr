### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Svenja Guhr, research associate at the [fortext lab](https://fortext.org/en/) in computational literary studies. My academic background is in German literature, Romance linguistics, and Digital Humanities. My PhD project focuses on the operationalisation and analysis of sound and loudness as narratological phenomena in German-language literary prose of the 19th and early 20th century.
